For my part in the SQL Injection Testing, 
I created a registration system that allows users to create a username, password and email for an account. 
Users are then permitted to login into their created account, via username and password. 
I designed the front-end in php and database back-end in MySQL. 
I then utilized the WAMP server for the successful implementation of the project. 
In order for the testing site to perform various functions I created multiple php files. 
First, I created a “register.php” page, that allows users to create a username and password for their account.
The “login.php” file allow users to login with their created credentials.
The server.php file facilitates the form and database validation and finally the index.php, provides some necessary structure and execution of a “landing” page.
