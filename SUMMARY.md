<p>This research was an attempt to utilize the Google Cloud Computing environment by automating the process of creating a virtual machine to create secure testing environments for web applications. By using a series of automated scripts, we created two separate web applications that use a php/mySQL framework on a LAMP server and REACT/Django REST Framework respectively and ran a series of security and quality assurance tests on them in sanitized environments. </p>
<h3>Note that web applications and Automation Scripts need to be in main directory in order to automation scripts to work. Otherwise, alter the scripts to match the proper directories.</h3>
